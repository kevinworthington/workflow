  "dc_description_s": "The dataset show the climate units in the Mexican side of the Rio Grande/Bravo.The dataset was clipped for the Mexican side of the Rio Grande/Bravo from the climatic units of Mexico. The Climas information scale 1: 1 000 000 was obtained through the conversion of analog to digital information, with methodology and processes designed by INEGI, which comply with the technical norms required for its integration and processing in Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The expectations of the use of this type of information are extended, offering, thus, new horizons of possibilities to satisfy the diverse needs and objectives of the users.This information represents the distribution of the different types of climate that exist in the Mexican Republic, according to the Climate Classification System of Koppen, modified by E. Garc\u00eda, with INEGI contributions, for the particular conditions of Mexico. For the construction of this dataset, average temperature and total precipitation of approximately 4000 meteorological stations existing in the country during the period of cartographic elaboration were used.According to the above-mentioned classification system, climate information is presented in its traditional form; By groups, subgroups, types and subtypes of climate, which are represented by climatic formulas that also include the characteristics of the temperature and precipitation regime of each type.The importance of this information is that it is indispensable for all types of studies and can be correlated with many or all the characteristics of the landscape, since the classification and delimitation of climatic zones assumes the existence of regions with climate type Similar, with discernible limits that share common characteristics, especially as regards vegetation and soil.",
