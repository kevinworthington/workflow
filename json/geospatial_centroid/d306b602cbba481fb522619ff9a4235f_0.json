(http://www.ose.state.nm.us/GIS/PODS/nmose_WATERS_PODs_data_dictionary_v8.xlsx) The NM Office of the State Engineer (OSE) \"Point of Diversions\" (POD) layer includes well locations, surface declarations, or surface permits updated on a monthly basis. These data were extracted from the OSE W.A.T.E.R.S. (Water Administration Technical Engineering Resource System) database and geo-located (mapped). These data have varying degrees of accuracy and have not been validated. Data included in this dataset only includes PODs that have coordinates located within the State of New Mexico. This message is to alert users of this data to various changes regarding how this POD data is generated and maintained by the NM Office of the State Engineer. In addition, all attribute fields are fully described in the metadata, including descriptions of field codes. Please read the metadata accompanying this GIS data layer for further information.
