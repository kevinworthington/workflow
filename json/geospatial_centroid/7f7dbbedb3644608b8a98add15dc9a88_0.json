The locations were obtained by theWater Supply Division as recorded from various sources and built using the best existing location dataavailable from these sources. Although some location errors were found and corrected in the process,some errors still remain. As resources allow, TCEQ intends to improve the accuracy of these locations tomeet the standards set forth in the agency's Positional Data Policy. This layer was developed to supportthe TCEQ's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program (SWAP).",
