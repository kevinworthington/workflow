The map contains the geographical identification of the 192 245 inhabited localities, as a result of the 2010 Population and Housing Census. Each registry includes the values of length, latitude, altitude and total population.This shapefile was created by selecting all the localities with populations greater than 5,000 within the boundary of the RGB watershed, as delinated in the UC-Davis geodatabase (located here: L:\\Interns_stuff\\Kristin\\GIS\\From_Pablo\\170311_RGB_geodatabase\\Hydrology_and_Climate\\RGB_watershed). This shapefile was created by Kristin Davis, CSU Geospatial Centroid intern, on November 27, 2018 for the Rio Grande Basin Environmental Justice project.",
