It represents the spatial geometry, carries the attributes, and contains linear referencing measures for locating features or \"events\" on the network. Additional NHDFlowline features are canal/ditch, pipeline, connector, underground conduit, and coastline.The most current version of the National Hydrography Dataset, the NHD High Resolution, is mapped at a scale of 1:24,000 scale or better (1:63,360 or better in Alaska). These data are updated and maintained through Stewardship partnerships with states and other collaborative bodies.",
