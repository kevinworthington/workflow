The model was developed at Oregon State University and information about the gridded ASCII data sets can be obtained from: http://www.ocs.orst.edu/prism/.Procedures_Used: 1. Aquired the PRISM ASCII files from Oregon Climate Service (http://www.ocs.orst.edu/prism/). 2. Aquired the United State boundary coverage (1:2,000,000) from the GAP Analysis Project Office at the University of Idaho http://www.wildlife.uidaho.edu/). This coverage was orignally obtained by GAP from the ESRI data site (www.esri.com). 3. Ran the main aml (koeppen.aml) to produce the classification. 4. Merged the individual grids into one grid containing the lowest subclasses.",
