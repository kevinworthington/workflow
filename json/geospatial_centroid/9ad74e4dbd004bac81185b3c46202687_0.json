These data delineate the areal extent of riparian habitats as defined by A System For Mapping Riparian Areas in the United States (USFWS 2009). Certain riparian habitats may be excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect riparian habitats.Data are in WGS84.",
